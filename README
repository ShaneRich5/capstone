# AUTO GRADER

This repository contains the final year capstone project created by my group.
It is primarily built with the java Play! framework that handles the backend
computation.

This readme partially acts a development journal and will be updated a weekly
basis, in the form of progress reports.

# How it works

The application is intended to analyze programs created by students against 
lecturer defined constraints.

# Progress

## Week 1

The application is currently deployed and hosted on digital ocean, and monitored
with the jenkins CI system.

# Contributing

The repository is currently limited to contributions from the capstone team,
namely: 
* Kerry-ann Lewis
* Tevin
* Shane Richards
* Yerodin Richards

# Workflow

The master branch is exclusively intended to hold production ready code. This is to
ensure the build is not broken and the live demonstration is always available. Merging
into the master branch will trigger continuous integration tests by jenkins.
